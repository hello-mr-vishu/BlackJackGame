* Card: Represents a single card with a suit and a rank.
* Deck: Represents a deck of cards. It can shuffle the deck and deal a specified number of cards.
* Hand: Represents a hand of cards. It can calculate the value of the hand and check if the hand is a blackjack.
* Game: Represents a game of Black Jack. It controls the game flow and checks for the winner.

 #### Rules
* There will be only two players. One human and one computer (for the Base solution).

* The computer will always be the dealer.

* Each player gets dealt two cards to start.

* The player goes first, and decides if they want to hit (draw a card) or stand (end their turn).

* The dealer has to hit if their hand is below 17.

* Each players' score is the total of their card ranks. Jacks/Queen/Kings are 10. Aces can be 1 or 11.

* The player who is closer to, but not above 21 wins the hand.
